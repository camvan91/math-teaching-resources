If you can answer the following problems, you should be well-prepared for Quiz 5:



\begin{enumerate}
 \item Let $f(x,y)=xy$ and suppose $x=g(t)$ and $y=h(t)$. Show that applying the chain rule to the derivative $
\dfrac{d}{dt}f(g(t),h(t))= \dfrac{d}{dt}(g(t)h(t))$ produces the product rule for derivatives in one variable.
 \item Suppose an insect is flying through a room along the path
 \[
 r(t) = (e^t, t^2, \sin t),
 \]
 and that the temperature in the room is given by $T(x,y,z) = \sin(x)\cos(y)\sqrt{z}$. Find the rate $\dfrac{dT}{dt}$ at which the temperature experienced by the insect changes as it flies through the room.
 \item Consider the function $F:D\subseteq \R^2\to\R^2$, where $D=\{(u,v)|v\geq 1\}$, given by
 \[
 F(u,v) = \left(\sqrt[3]{uv},\sqrt[3]{\frac{u}{v^2}}\right).
 \]
 Calculate the derivative matrix $D_{(u,v)}f$ at a general point $(u,v)\in D$.
 
 {\em Suggestion:} When computing partial derivatives, you could go ahead and work with the functions as given, using the chain rule and product/quotient rules, or you could write, for example, $\sqrt[3]{uv} = u^{1/3}v^{1/3}$. (Always choose the most convenient possible form for your functions before differentiating!)
 
 \item Let $g(x,y) = xy^2\cos(xy)$, where $x=\sqrt[3]{uv}$ and $y=\sqrt[3]{\dfrac{u}{v^2}}$. Compute $\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial u}$ and $\dfrac{\partial g}{\partial v}$ using the Chain Rule.
 
 (Note that $(x,y)=F(u,v)$, where $F$ is the function from the previous problem.)
 
 \item What is the {\bf gradient} of a continuously differentiable function $f:\R^3\to\R$? How is the gradient of $f$ related to the derivative $D_{(x,y,z)}f$?
 
 \item Calculate the gradient of the function $f(x,y)=3x^2-4xy$ at the point $(1,2)$.
\end{enumerate}
