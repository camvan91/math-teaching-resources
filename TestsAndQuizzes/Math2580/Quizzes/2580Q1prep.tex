If you can answer the following problems, you should be well-prepared for Quiz 1:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item At what point does the line through the point $(1,0,3)$ in the direction of the vector $\mathbf{v} = \i+2\j+\k$ cross the $xy$-plane?
 \item Find the distance from the point $(1,2,0)$ to the plane $x-2y+z=4$.
 \item Find the area of the triangle whose vertices are $(0,1,2)$, $(1,1,1)$, and $(2,1,0)$.
 \item Determine the domain of the function $f(x,y) = \dfrac{x+y}{x^2+y^2-1}$ and find the value $f(1,2)$.
 \item For a given function $f(x,y)$ of two variables and a value $c$ in the range of $f$, what is the difference between the {\em level curve} $f(x,y)=c$ and the {\em section}\footnote{Sections are also known as {\em traces}} of the graph $z=f(x,y)$ corresponding to $z=c$? How are the two related?
 \item The subset of $\R^2$ defined by the equation $x^2+y^2=1$ is the unit circle. What does this equation define as a subset of $\R^3$?
\end{enumerate}
