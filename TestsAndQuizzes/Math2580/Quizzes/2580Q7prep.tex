If you can answer the following problems, you should be well-prepared for Quiz 7:



\begin{enumerate}
 \item Find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface $x^2+2y^2+3xz=10$ at the point $(1,2,\frac{1}{3})$.
 \item On Assignment 3 you're asked to derive the following formula: if $y=g(x)$ is a function satisfying the relation $F(x,y)=C$ for some constant $C$, then
\[
 \frac{dy}{dx} = g'(x) = -\frac{F_x(x,g(x))}{F_y(x,g(x))}.
\]
Use this result to find the slope of the tangent line to the curve $x^2+y^4=5$ at the point $(2,1)$.
 \item Let $F(x,y,z) = xy^2-x^2z+2yz^2$, and suppose $z=g(x,y)$ satisfies the relation $F(x,y,z)=1$. Use implicit differentiation to compute $g_x(1,1)$ and $g_y(1,1)$.

{\em Hint:} Calculate the partial derivative of both sides of the equation $xy^2-x^2z+2yz^2=1$ with respect to both $x$ and $y$, and keep in mind that $z$ is assumed to be a function of $x$ and $y$.

 \item Suppose $\vec{n} = \langle a,b,c\rangle$ is the normal vector for the tangent plane at a point on surface in $\R^3$. What can you say about the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ if the plane is
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Horizontal?
 \item Vertical?
\end{enumerate}
 \item Find any points $(a,b)$ at which the tangent plane to the surface $z=x^2-2x+y^2$ is horizontal.
\end{enumerate}
