Please submit solutions to the following problems (except where indicated). As usual, all the textbook exercises are recommended as practice problems if they don't appear as an assigned problem below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that any normed vector space is a metric space.
\item Let $X={l}^\infty$ denote the set of all {\em bounded} sequences of real numbers. (Thus, $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots)\in X$ if there exists some $M\geq 0$ such that $\abs{x_i}\leq M$ for all $i=1,2,3,\ldots$. Prove that $\len{x} = \sup\{\abs{x_n}:n\in\N\}$ defines a norm on $X$. 
\item Let $A$ be a subset of a metric space $X$. An element $a\in A$ is called an {\em isolated point} of $A$ if there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that $N_\epsilon(a)\cap A = \{a\}$. Prove that the closure of $A$ is equal to the disjoint union of the limit points of $A$ and the isolated points of $A$.
\item Let $X$ be a topological space and $A\subseteq X$. Prove that $\overline{A} = X\setminus (X\setminus A)^\circ$. That is, the closure of $A$ is the complement of the interior of the complement of $A$.
\item Let $S$ be a subset of a topological space $X$, and let $S$ be given the subspace topology. Show that if $A$ is a relatively open subset of $S$, then $A\cap T$ is a relatively open subset of $S\cap T$ for any subset $T\subseteq X$.
\item Under what condition is a space $X$ with the cofinite topology a Hausdorff space?
\end{enumerate}
